### Day 1: January 3, 2019 (California Housing Price Prediction)
##### (Made a Youtube Video)

**Today's Progress:** Used Calfornia Housing Price Dataset to predict housing prices using Keras.

**Thoughts:** Even though linear regression is better suited for this kind of work, I used a sequential neural network written using Keras to predict housing prices which went pretty well.
